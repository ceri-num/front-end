# Component Rendering
There is three things to figure out for rendering a component :
* Where this component will be placed on the page and its objectif
* What are the DOM command that can be used within the template
* How to setup the reactivity of your component, so that it becomes dynamic

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section we do not focus on binding data yet. Check the [property section](property.md) for this kind of information.
{% endhint %}

## Binding
Binding consists of linking data in the `<script>` section of your component with the `<template>` section of the same component. In Vue.js the simpliest way to bind data is to use the `{{ Mustache }}` tag (two `{`, your data, then two `}`). While the component is rendered, the tag will be replaced with the content of the data used within the mustache.

```html
<template>
    {{ user.name }} <!--will print the attribute of the variable user -->
</template>
```

Mustache can handle complex JavaScript operation too
```html
<template>
    {{ user.getLevel() + user.increaseXP()) }}
</template>
```
{% hint style="warning" %}
Everything in the mustache tag will be interpreted! You cannot put html elements in there.
{% endhint %}

### Binding directives
Nonetheless, mustache tag has some limitation, especially within the HTML attributes since they cannot be used. For example, **you can't** write `<div id="{{myDynamicId}}">`: this will throw an error. To circumvent this issue, Vue.js introduces directives which are special-interpreted HTML attributes.

The most important one is the `v-bind` directive. This directive allows to bind a **standard** HTML attribute element to a **custom data**. For example, you can bind your data with the `id` of an element using the `v-bind`directive.

```html
<template>
    <div v-bind:id="myDynamicId"></div>
    <a v-bind:href="myDynaLink">linkmesenpai</a><!--or any other html attribute!-->
</template>
```

There also exists dynamic binding, which allows you to use varibale to determine which HTML property you want to bind your data with. Check the documentation if your are interested.

Two way data binding allows a child component to update its direct parent. It is mostly used for forms. Check [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html) for more information.

## Template syntax
We will see in this section some handful syntaxex to define how your component should render according to its state (its data).

### Conditional rendering
In your component template, you will often face the necessity to check if a variable exists in order to display specific information. For instance, you want to display user's information only if he/she is logged in your application, otherwise you don't have access to this information.

To do that, Vue.js introduce the `v-if` directive. It is used to conditionally render a block: the block will be rendered only if the expression value is computed to `true`. You also have the `v-else-if` and `v-else` directive, obviously.

```html
<template>
    <p v-if="user">Hello {{ user.name }}</p> <!--if the user exists, then we have its name-->
    <p v-else> Hey! You! Log you, Yeah! You!</p>
</template>
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
A directive **has to be attached** to **only one** element. If you want to toggle more than one HTML element with you directive, you must use it on a `<template>` element, which serves as an invisible wrapper.
```html
<template v-if="ok">
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Paragraph 1</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2</p>
</template>
```
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
There is also the `v-show` directive used to conditionnaly render a block. The cost of the rendering operations is not the same. `v-if` always destroy its content if the condition is false, while `v-show` relies on CSS property to hide the content thus don't have to recreate the all content if the variable becomes true again. If you have costly drawing often toggling, maybe `v-show` can be better.
{% endhint %}

### Loop/list rendering
Another common needs is to dynamicaly render list of elements in a page. Vue.js introduces the `v-for` directive for addressing this need. It uses a special syntax `item in items` (if `items` is the array, `item` is an alias for the array element: it can be anything else). You can also retrieve the key/index of the element iterated with the special syntax `(item, index) in items`.

You can use `v-for` to render a list based on an array.
```html
<ul>
    <li v-for="myItem in items"> <!-- items: [{ message: Foo}, {message: Bar}]-->
        {{ myItem.message }}
    </li>
</ul>
```
Here, a first `<li>` element will be rendered with the Foo message, and the second with the Bar message.

It is also possible to iterate over an object's properties with the same directive.
```html
<ul id="v-for-object">
  <li v-for="(prop, key) in myobject"> <!-- myObject { name: "Soen", level: "3Dan", xp: 150,}-->
    {{key}} is: {{ prop }}
  </li>
</ul>
```
Here, the first `<li>` will display Name is: Soen, and so on.

{% hint style="info" %}
Same as other directive, if you want to render several elements in the `v-for` directive, you must use it on a `<template>`.
{% endhint %}

Another important things for the `v-for` directive is about maintaining the state of your list up to date. Whenever possible, it is higly recommended by Vue.js assign a unique `key` to the alias element created (here `item` and `prop`) when possible (the value **must** be numeric or string). To do so:
```html
<li v-for="item in items" v-bind:key="item.id"> <!--we know that .id is unique across all the element of your array, we can use it as a key -->
```

## Vue.js reactivity
When a Vue.js instance is created, it adds all the properties found in its `data` object to the reactivity system of the framework. When values of those properties change, the view will automatically “react”, updating itself to match the new values. This is a **powerful feature** that you should intensively use (it is somewhat a reimplementation of the observer pattern).

Each component has a `data` object. For every component but the main component `Vue.vue`, data **must be** a function, otherwise, the data will be shared accross the difference instances of the same component.

In the `<script>` element of your component, you should have:
```js
data(){ // the data, declared as function
    return{ // we return all the properties that should be react on.
      name: "Yo!",
      value: 15,
    }
  },
```

Then, during using app, if you change the value of `name`, this change will reflect on the template of the component.

## Instance Lifecycle Hooks
Lifecycle hooks are special functions which allow user to perform specifics operations at certain moment of the creation and the rendering of a component. For example, just before your component goes `mounted` to the page, you can modify the component's data.

```js
data(){
    return{
        value : -1;
    }
}

mounted: function(){
    console.log("Component mounted!");
    value = DEFAULT_MOUNT_VALUE;
}
```

Below a diagram of the lifecycle of a component and the associated hooks.
